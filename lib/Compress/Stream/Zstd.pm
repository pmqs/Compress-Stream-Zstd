=head1 NAME

Compress::Stream::Zstd - Perl interface to the Zstd (Zstandard) (de)compressor

=head1 NOTE

This module is a fork of L<Compress-Zstd|https://github.com/spiritloose/Compress-Zstd>.
It contains a few changes to make streaming compression/uncompression more robust.
The only reason for this fork is to allow the module to work with `IO-Compress-Zstd`.
The hope is that the changes made here can be merged back upstream and this module can be retired.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Compress::Stream::Zstd;

    my $compressed = compress($bytes);
    my $decompressed = decompress($compressed);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Compress::Stream::Zstd module provides an interface to the Zstd (de)compressor.

buffer can be either a scalar or a scalar reference.

On error undef is returned.

=head2 decompress($source)

=head2 uncompress($source)

Decompresses the given buffer and returns the resulting bytes. The input
buffer can be either a scalar or a scalar reference.
