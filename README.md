# NAME

Compress::Stream::Zstd - Perl interface to the Zstd (Zstandard) (de)compressor

# NOTE

This module is a branch of `Compress::Zstd` that contains extra support for working
in streaming mode.
This change has been made to allow the module to work with `IO::Compress::Zstd`.

# SYNOPSIS

    use Compress::Stream::Zstd;

    my $compressed = compress($bytes);
    my $decompressed = decompress($compressed);

# DESCRIPTION

The Compress::Stream::Zstd module provides an interface to the Zstd (de)compressor.

# FUNCTIONS

## compress($source \[, $level\])

Compresses the given buffer and returns the resulting bytes. The input
buffer can be either a scalar or a scalar reference.

On error undef is returned.

## compress\_mt($source, $num\_threads \[, $level\])

Multi-threaded version of the `compress` function.

Note that this function uses experimental API of Zstandard.

## decompress($source)

## uncompress($source)

Decompresses the given buffer and returns the resulting bytes. The input
buffer can be either a scalar or a scalar reference.

On error (in case of corrupted data) undef is returned.
